The binaries have the same name but are in separate folders. To run your app on a device, navigate to the location where you downloaded the App SDK and select the SkypeForBusiness.framework file in the AppSDKiOS folder. To run your app in a simulator, selec the SkypeForBusiness.framework file in the AppSDKiOSSimulator folder.
